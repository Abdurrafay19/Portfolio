                  Common Mistakes I Made as a New Developer (And How I Fixed

                </h1>

                <p>
                  Starting out as a developer is exciting, but it can also be
                  overwhelming. I made a lot of mistakes in the beginning that
                  slowed down my progress. In this blog post, I'll share the
                  most common ones I made, how I corrected them, and what I
                  learned in the process. Hopefully, this helps you avoid the
                  same pitfalls.
                </p>

                <h5>Mistake 1: Trying to Learn Everything at Once</h5>
                <p>
                  I jumped into learning multiple technologies at the same time.
                  I was studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flutter, Firebase,
                  Node.js, and others with no clear plan. This made me feel busy
                  but not productive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now I focus on one stack at a time. I started with app
                  development with Flutter, then moved to web fundamentals. This
                  structured approach gave me deeper understanding and faster
                  results.
                </p>

                <h5>Mistake 2: Skipping the Fundamentals</h5>
                <p>
                  I often copied code from tutorials without understanding it.
                  This left me stuck when errors came up. I now read
                  documentation, explore core concepts like the DOM, state, and
                  data flow, and build projects from scratch.
                </p>

                <h5>Mistake 3: Not Using Version Control</h5>
                <p>
                  I avoided Git and saved multiple folders like "final-project"
                  or "latest-working". This was chaotic and unprofessional.
                  Today, I use GitHub for every project to track changes,
                  collaborate, and showcase my work.
                </p>

                <h5>Mistake 4: Ignoring UI/UX Design</h5>
                <p>
                  In the beginning, I focused only on making things work, not
                  how they looked or felt. My interfaces were clunky and
                  inconsistent. Now, I prioritize responsive, clean,
                  user-friendly layouts in all my work.
                </p>

                <h5>Mistake 5: Avoiding Real Projects</h5>
                <p>
                  For months, I watched tutorials without applying what I
                  learned. Once I started creating real projects like a
                  calculator, a to-do list, and my own portfolio, my learning
                  speed multiplied. Real experience matters.
                </p>

                <h5>Mistake 6: Comparing Myself to Others</h5>
                <p>
                  I used to feel behind when I saw others posting advanced
                  projects. Over time, I realized everyone has a different
                  journey. Now I track my own progress and focus on consistent
                  improvement.
                </p>

                <h5>Mistake 7: Ignoring Documentation</h5>
                <p>
                  I thought documentation was boring. I relied only on videos
                  and blog posts. Now, I rely on official docs for Flutter,
                  JavaScript, and other tools. It has made me a more confident
                  and independent problem-solver.
                </p>

                <ul class="list">
                  <li>
                    - Learn one technology deeply before jumping to the next
                  </li>
                  <li>- Focus on understanding, not copying</li>
                  <li>- Use Git from the beginning</li>
                  <li>- Prioritize clean, user-friendly design</li>
                  <li>- Build real projects, not just follow tutorials</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Everyone makes mistakes. The key is to learn from them. If
                  you're starting out as a developer, I hope this post helps you
                  avoid some of the early confusion and grow faster in your
                  journey. You can check out the projects I mentioned on my
                  portfolio.
